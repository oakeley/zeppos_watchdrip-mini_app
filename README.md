 # Watchdrip Companion App for ZEPP OS (Blood sugar monitor) 

This is a clone of BigDigital's awesome work. The only minor change is that during glucose updates for Zepp OS v3+ the original version blanked the screen for 2-3 seconds and only showed a spinning wheel. 
I have replaced that with the time and glucose together with a dotted progress bar.
It should autodetect your screen size and shape and scale the fonts to fit. 

Let me know if you experience issues (my Discord handle is @draedie)

This repository contains a ZEPP OS watch app which is designed to work together with <a href="https://github.com/bigdigital/zeppos_watchdrip_timer_wf">watchface</a>
and Android phone Watchdrip application (see the latest version on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/xdrip_miband">Patreon page</a>). 
The app is proving side app API for the watchface, so the watchface could directly fetch data from the Android App.
As a additional option this app also can directly display the fetched data.
